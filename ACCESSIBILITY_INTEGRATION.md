# Accessibility Integration for Game Generation

> **Note:** This system has been updated to focus on **basic functionality testing** rather than comprehensive accessibility standards. The file has been renamed to `test_functionality.py` and the testing criteria have been simplified to ensure games are functional and playable.

## Overview

This document describes the accessibility testing integration that has been implemented into the game generation workflow. The system now ensures that all generated games meet basic accessibility standards before being deployed.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Accessibility Testing Script (`.github/scripts/test_accessibility.py`)

**New Features:**
- **8 Accessibility Criteria** (increased from 6 to 8)
- **12-point scoring system** (increased from 10 to 12)
- **CI/CD Integration** with proper exit codes
- **Enhanced detection patterns** for better accuracy

**Accessibility Criteria Tested:**

1. **Keyboard Navigation** (2 points)
   - Detects: `keydown`, `keyup`, `keypress`, `arrow`, `space`, `enter`, `escape`, `tab`
   - Ensures games can be played without a mouse

2. **Color Independence** (2 points)
   - Detects color-dependent logic patterns
   - Ensures games don't rely solely on color for gameplay

3. **Text Alternatives** (2 points)
   - Detects: `alt`, `aria-label`, `title`, `textContent`, `innerText`, `aria-describedby`
   - Ensures visual elements have text descriptions

4. **Audio Alternatives** (2 points)
   - Detects audio usage and checks for visual alternatives
   - Looks for: `flash`, `blink`, `pulse`, `glow`, `shake`, `bounce`, `fade`, `scale`

5. **Clear Instructions** (1 point)
   - Detects: `instruction`, `help`, `guide`, `tutorial`, `explain`, `how to`, `press`, `click`
   - Ensures games provide clear guidance

6. **Error Handling** (1 point)
   - Detects: `error`, `catch`, `try`, `invalid`, `wrong`, `incorrect`, `console.error`, `console.warn`
   - Ensures games handle errors gracefully

7. **Focus Management** (1 point) - **NEW**
   - Detects: `focus`, `blur`, `tabindex`, `aria-hidden`
   - Ensures proper keyboard navigation flow

8. **Responsive Design** (1 point) - **NEW**
   - Detects: `window.innerWidth`, `window.innerHeight`, `resize`, `media query`, `canvas.width`, `canvas.height`
   - Ensures games adapt to different screen sizes

### 2. Integrated Game Generation Workflow (`.github/scripts/generate_game_with_assistant.py`)

**New Features:**
- **Automatic accessibility testing** after game generation
- **Accessibility improvement attempts** if initial score is below 60%
- **Accessibility metadata** stored in game files
- **Robust error handling** for accessibility testing

**Workflow Steps:**
1. Generate initial game
2. Test accessibility score
3. If below 60%, attempt to improve accessibility
4. Test final version
5. Save game with accessibility metadata
6. Improve visuals/audio (existing step)
7. Test accessibility of final version
8. Save final accessibility scores

### 3. Enhanced GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/game_of_the_day_with_assistant.yml`)

**New Features:**
- **Dedicated accessibility testing step**
- **Accessibility verification step** that fails the workflow if standards aren't met
- **Comprehensive accessibility reporting**

**Workflow Steps:**
1. Generate game using OpenAI Assistant
2. Run accessibility tests on all games
3. Verify latest game meets accessibility standards
4. Fail workflow if accessibility threshold not met
5. Commit and push only if all tests pass

## Current Status

### Accessibility Test Results (as of latest test):
- **Total games tested:** 28
- **Games passing (≥60%):** 23
- **Games failing:** 5
- **Average score:** 71.7%

### Games Needing Improvement:
- `2025-07-27.js`: 33.3% (No keyboard controls)
- `2025-07-06.js`: 50.0%
- `2025-07-15.js`: 58.3%
- `2025-07-17.js`: 58.3%
- `2025-08-03.js`: 58.3% (No keyboard controls)

### Top Performing Games:
- `2025-08-04.js`: 100.0% (Perfect score!)
- `2025-07-13.js`: 91.7%
- `2025-07-22.js`: 83.3%

## Benefits

### For Users:
- **Inclusive gaming experience** for children with different abilities
- **Keyboard-only gameplay** support
- **Visual alternatives** to audio cues
- **Clear instructions** and error messages
- **Responsive design** for different devices

### For Developers:
- **Automated quality assurance** for accessibility
- **Comprehensive testing** before deployment
- **Detailed reporting** of accessibility issues
- **Continuous improvement** through automated feedback

### For the Project:
- **Higher quality games** that meet accessibility standards
- **Reduced manual testing** requirements
- **Consistent accessibility** across all generated games
- **Better user experience** for all children

## Configuration

### Accessibility Threshold
- **Current threshold:** 60% (configurable in `ACCESSIBILITY_THRESHOLD`)
- **Scoring system:** 12-point scale
- **Passing criteria:** ≥60% score

### Testing Frequency
- **Automated:** Daily with game generation
- **Manual:** Can be run anytime with `python3 .github/scripts/test_accessibility.py`
- **CI/CD:** Integrated into GitHub Actions workflow

## Usage

### Running Accessibility Tests Manually:
```bash
python3 .github/scripts/test_accessibility.py
```

### Testing a Specific Game:
```python
from .github.scripts.test_accessibility import validate_accessibility

with open('games/2025-08-04.js', 'r') as f:
    game_code = f.read()

result = validate_accessibility(game_code, '2025-08-04.js')
print(f"Accessibility Score: {result['percentage']:.1f}%")
```

### Checking Game Metadata:
```python
import json

with open('games/2025-08-04.meta.json', 'r') as f:
    metadata = json.load(f)

accessibility = metadata['final_accessibility']
print(f"Final Score: {accessibility['percentage']:.1f}%")
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:
1. **Screen reader compatibility** testing
2. **Contrast ratio** analysis
3. **Motion sensitivity** warnings
4. **Cognitive accessibility** scoring
5. **Multi-language** accessibility support

### Integration Opportunities:
1. **Lighthouse CI** integration for web accessibility
2. **axe-core** automated testing
3. **WCAG 2.1** compliance checking
4. **Real user testing** feedback integration

## Conclusion

The accessibility integration ensures that all generated games are inclusive and accessible to children with different abilities. The automated testing and improvement workflow guarantees consistent quality while reducing manual effort. This creates a better learning experience for all children and demonstrates a commitment to inclusive educational technology.
